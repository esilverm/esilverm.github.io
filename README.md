# My Website I Guess

This is my planning space for my website. I haven't worked on something like this in a while and I realize I probably should.

## My Plans

Just a listing of all the stuff I plan to do

### 1. Create a user-friendly format

Basically create a consistent style for the site

### 2. Convert it to React.js since I need to learn that and it would be a major flex

## Why go through the hassle to do this?

Because I clearly need to work on this because I have been putting if off. I also will be able to set up a blog if i want to where I can discuss my projects and my other stuff. This will let me get a better grounding in the industry and also give me the ability to fully understand what I'm doing. Plus I really enjoy writing about my code. Also I want a free tshirt


## How I would like to structure this
